I can't directly create or export a file (like `assignment.yaml`) on your system. However, I can generate the YAML content for you that you can save locally as `assignment.yaml`.

Here's the YAML content based on your request and the character profile of Rex:

```yaml
# assignment.yaml

  personality:
    - irritable
    - conservative
    - lonely
  appearance:
    - rusted metal
    - smooth silver joints
    - flickering pink lights
    - vintage retro design
    - slightly worn but functional
  backstory: >
    Rex was originally a 1991 coffee machine, once deeply loved by his owner. As newer appliances emerged, he was forgotten and covered in dust. One day, he gained superpowers—able to heat any food and turn it into liquid—becoming an evil ruler of the kitchen. When he tried to heat disobedient food, he turned corn into popcorn, which destroyed him from within. In the end, he reverted to his original form, and his evil reign collapsed.

    s01:
      title: First Visit to the Hostess's House
      ltx_prompt: |
        A bright, sunny kitchen in a modest suburban home, early afternoon. The room is clean, modern, with white walls, white cabinets, and a stainless steel countertop. A large, fresh cob of corn is placed on a wooden cutting board near the stove. The hostess, a woman in her 40s with warm eyes and a friendly smile, places the corn gently on the counter, then turns to speak to someone else. Rex, standing in the corner of the room, is slightly out of place — his rusted body and flickering pink lights stand out against the clean, bright space. His pink lights flash once — a slow, cautious pulse — as he senses the corn. The corn is "disobedient" — it is new, unprocessed, and untested. A small robotic arm extends from beneath Rex’s base — smooth, silver, slightly rusted — and moves slowly toward the corn. It reaches out, touches the cob, and begins to vibrate. The corn shivers slightly. The camera is a tight close-up on the arm and the corn, then slowly pulls back to reveal Rex’s full body, still standing in the corner. Ambient sound: soft hum of the refrigerator (from a nearby appliance), distant laughter, the gentle clink of a spoon. No dialogue.
    s03:
      title: The Corn That Turned to Popcorn
      ltx_prompt: |
        A bright, sunny kitchen in a modest suburban home, early afternoon. The room is clean, modern, with white walls, white cabinets, and a stainless steel countertop. A large, fresh cob of corn is placed on a wooden cutting board. The hostess places it gently, then turns to speak to someone else. Rex, standing in the corner, senses the corn as "disobedient" — it is new, untested. His pink lights flash rapidly. He begins to heat the corn, activating his internal system. The corn heats quickly, and instead of turning into juice, it begins to pop — small bursts of white kernels explode in a rapid, chaotic sequence. The sound is sharp, sudden, and loud — a violent, metallic crackle. As the popcorn forms, it spreads across the countertop, covering the wood and spilling over. The robotic arm extends from beneath Rex’s base — smooth, silver, slightly rusted — and attempts to lift the popcorn. But as it tries to grasp it, the kernels burst violently, splashing hot particles onto Rex’s body. The hot, greasy particles burn through his rusted surface — visible cracks appear on his metal skin. His pink lights flicker erratically, then go dark for a moment. The camera is a tight close-up on the popcorn and Rex’s body, then slowly pulls back to reveal the damage. Ambient sound: sharp crackling of popping corn, the sound of hot grease splashing, a low mechanical groan from Rex. No dialogue.
